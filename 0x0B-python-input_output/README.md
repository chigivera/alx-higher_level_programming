# Python - Input/Output

This project covers file handling, JSON serialization/deserialization, and working with text files in Python.

## Files

* `0-read_file.py`: Function that reads a text file and prints its contents to stdout
* `1-write_file.py`: Function that writes a string to a text file and returns number of characters written
* `2-append_write.py`: Function that appends a string to end of text file and returns number of characters added
* `3-to_json_string.py`: Function that returns JSON string representation of an object
* `4-from_json_string.py`: Function that returns Python object from JSON string representation
* `5-save_to_json_file.py`: Function that writes an object to text file using JSON representation
* `6-load_from_json_file.py`: Function that creates an object from a JSON file
* `7-add_item.py`: Script that adds command line arguments to a Python list saved in a file
* `8-class_to_json.py`: Function that returns dictionary description of object for JSON serialization
* `9-student.py`: Class Student that defines student by first_name, last_name and age
* `10-student.py`: Enhanced Student class with filtered attribute retrieval
* `11-student.py`: Further enhanced Student class with JSON serialization/deserialization
* `12-pascal_triangle.py`: Function that returns Pascal's Triangle as a list of lists
